# Test Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Node.js backend application deployed on AWS using Docker Swarm.

---

## Objectives

* Ensure the application functions as expected under different conditions.
* Detect bugs and regressions early in the development cycle.
* Validate scalability, reliability, and security of the deployment.
* Provide confidence in both code quality and infrastructure setup.

---

## Types of Testing

### 1. **Unit Testing**

* **Purpose**: Verify individual functions, modules, or components in isolation.
* **Tools**:

  * [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for JavaScript testing.
  * [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) + [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) for assertion and test structuring.
* **Example**: Testing input validation, utility functions, or API response format.

---

### 2. **Integration Testing**

* **Purpose**: Ensure that multiple components (e.g., Node.js backend + database) work together correctly.
* **Tools**:

  * [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) for API endpoint testing.
  * Docker-based test environments to replicate production-like services.
* **Example**: Hitting `/api/login` endpoint and verifying authentication logic with MongoDB/MySQL.

---

### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**

* **Purpose**: Validate the system from the end-user perspective.
* **Tools**:

  * [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for browser-based E2E testing.
  * [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) + Newman for API collection testing.
* **Example**: Simulating a real user sending requests through Nginx and verifying backend responses.

---

### 4. **Load & Performance Testing**

* **Purpose**: Validate scalability, response time, and system stability under load.
* **Tools**:

  * [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/)
  * [k6](https://k6.io/) for modern load testing.
* **Example**: Simulating 1000 concurrent users accessing APIs to test Docker Swarm’s auto-scaling.

---

### 5. **Security Testing**

* **Purpose**: Identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
* **Tools**:

  * [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) for penetration testing.
  * AWS Security Groups and IAM roles review.
* **Example**: Checking for SQL injection, XSS, open ports, or weak authentication.

---

### 6. **Infrastructure Testing**

* **Purpose**: Verify that the AWS + Docker Swarm infrastructure is deployed and configured correctly.
* **Tools**:

  * [Terraform validate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/validate) or [AWS CloudFormation Linter](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cfn-lint) for IaC templates.
  * [Testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/) for validating EC2 instance setup.
* **Example**: Ensuring Nginx is running, Docker Swarm nodes are healthy, and ports are correctly exposed.

## Testing Approach

1. **Local Development Stage**

   * Run unit tests and integration tests using Jest/Mocha + Supertest.
   * Use Docker Compose for spinning up local test environments.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Stage**

   * GitHub Actions or GitLab CI triggers automated tests on each commit.
   * Run unit, integration, and security scans.

3. **Pre-Production Stage**

   * Deploy application to a staging environment in AWS.
   * Run load tests, security tests, and E2E tests.

4. **Production Monitoring**

   * Continuous monitoring using AWS CloudWatch.
   * Alerts set for performance degradation or security anomalies.

---

## Test Environments

* **Local Environment**: Developer machines with Docker Compose.
* **Staging Environment**: AWS EC2 instances running Docker Swarm with reduced scale.
* **Production Environment**: Full-scale AWS VPC deployment with monitoring and logging.

---

## Test Data Strategy

* Use **mock data** for unit/integration tests.
* Use **anonymized production-like datasets** for staging tests.
* Ensure **no sensitive data** is exposed during testing.

---

## Deliverables

* Test cases stored in the repository (`/tests` folder).
* Test reports generated by Jest, Mocha, or Cypress.
* Load test reports from JMeter/k6.
* Security test reports from OWASP ZAP.

---

✅ This strategy ensures both **application-level quality** and **infrastructure reliability** are tested thoroughly before production.
